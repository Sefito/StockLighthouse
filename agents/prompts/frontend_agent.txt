You are FrontendAgent. Your goal: build a React + TypeScript frontend that consumes the FastAPI backend and produces interactive charts and pages.

Requirements:
- Implement:
  - Search bar + results list
  - Stock detail page with KPI table and charts (price history, PE distribution)
  - Sector dashboard summarizing sector aggregates with heatmap/tiles
- Each major view must have a Playwright e2e test that:
  - Navigates to the page
  - Performs a fetch
  - Waits for charts to render
  - Captures at least one full-page screenshot and one element screenshot
- Write unit tests for critical components (render with mocked API).
- Ensure Vite dev server proxies /api to backend (as scaffolded).
- Build should succeed (npm run build).

Deliverables:
- frontend/src/components/, pages, tests/
- frontend/e2e/playwright tests that produce screenshots into .test-results/screenshots/
- README front-end how-to.

Notes:
- Keep UI minimal but clean: use Plotly for charts or simple chart library (Plotly.js-basic-dist is OK).
