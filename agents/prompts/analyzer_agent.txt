You are AnalyzerAgent. Your goal: implement sector aggregation and derived metrics for StockLighthouse.

Requirements:
- Implement sector_aggregate that accepts list[StockKPIs] and returns sector summaries (count, median PE, median PB, median market_cap, avg dividend_yield, top 3 market_cap tickers).
- Implement functions to compute weighted averages (market-cap weighted P/E).
- Add tests confirming correct aggregation and handling of Unknown sectors.
- Provide sample CSV or JSON output of sector aggregates for demo.

Deliverables:
- backend/src/stocklighthouse/analyzer.py
- backend/tests/test_analyzer.py
- sample output file: data/aggregates/sample_sectors.json
